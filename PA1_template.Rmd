# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")

activityDF <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activityDF, FUN=sum)

hist(stepsPerDay$steps, breaks = nrow(stepsPerDay),
     main = "", xlab = "Steps Per Day", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightblue")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay$steps)
medianStepsPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay$steps)
```

Mean number of steps taken per day: `r format(meanStepsPerDay, scientific = F)`

Median number of steps taken per day: `r medianStepsPerDay`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
